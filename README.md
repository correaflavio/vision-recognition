Meraki Vision together with ML image recognition capabilities to provide people coming and going identity and demographics information


## Business/Technical Challenge

Companies and families are looking for ways to intelligently monitor and identify their employees, visitors, customers and family members, when they come to the office, to a store, a industrial plant or at home. The technical challenge is how to do it in a scalable and easier way, where this can be deployed quickly, without the need of on premise hardware and providing information to the right person at the right time.

## Proposed Solution

The solution will encompass Cisco Meraki Cameras that will count the number of people, trigger snapshots captures of the people entering the venue and send it to a ML based image recognition cloud service like Amazon Rekognition. This service will detect people faces and compare with the corporate directory images to identify employees coming and going, can alert of non employees entering in locations only allowed for internal people. For customers or visitors, the solution can be used to detect the gender/demographics of the visitors going to a store and identifying a frequent customer. For families this can be used to notify when family members arrive at home or if unknown people is entering in your property.

An integration with Webex Teams can provide realtime information for company security teams, store managers or parents, via snapshots or alarms about people coming and going.
